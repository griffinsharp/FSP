# Introduction

[Kicker](https://kicker-app.herokuapp.com/#/), a [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/) clone, is a crowdfunding application that allows users to collectively help get innovative sneaker related projects, products, and services to the market. If the project receives full funding by the end of its campaign, project backers receive a tiered reward contingent on the amount they pledged. Sneakerheads, rejoice!
